# Dark-Matter-Substructure

The main code of this project can be found at https://github.com/shinichiroando/sashimi-c fro the cold dark matter case and at https://github.com/shinichiroando/sashimi-w for the warm dark matter case. This model is explained and shows its results in this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07691.pdf .

This project is for my master thesis at University of Amsterdam under the supervision of Professor Shinichiro Ando and Phd student Ariane Dekker.The main goal of this project is to add spatial information in the main dark matter halo substructure model for CDM and WDM cases that is reffered above with the proper repositories.

Dark matter halo substructure model for warm and dark matter cases of halos based on the SASHIMI project. The model works for a wide range of dark matter host halos and redshift, while it calculates the subhalos mass[Msolar] ,density [Msolar/pc^3], scale radius [pc] ,concentration (rs/rt) ,position [Rvir_host] and the respected weights of theses values.

The main two categories are the warm dark matter case and dark matter case with the respecetd folders to be WDM and CDM.
