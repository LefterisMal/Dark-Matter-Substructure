# Dark-Matter-Substructure

Dark matter halo substructure model for warm and dark matter cases of halos based on the SASHIMI project. The model works for a wide range of dark matter host halos and redshift, while it calculates the subhalos mass[Msolar] ,density [Msolar/pc^3], scale radius [pc] ,concentration (rs/rt) ,position [Rvir_host] and the respected weights of theses values.

The main two categories are the warm dark matter case and dark matter case with the respecetd folders to be WDM and CDM.
