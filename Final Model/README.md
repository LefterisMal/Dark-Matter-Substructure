# Dark-Matter-Substructure : New Model

The most successful substructure model case as described in Thesis.pdf in the senction Results/Cold Dark Matter Case/Adding more information in the model 4.1.4. This model shows great agreement regarding the resulted subhaloes spatial distribution with the observed Einasto profile from the Aquarius Project N-body dark matter simulation (https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0898) for a wide range of mass and redshift host's values.

The notebook New_model_CDM_all.ipynb contains the main results of the Thesis.pdf of the new model case, with these results to contains mass function,satellite galaxies, substructure mass fractio, anihillation boost factor and simulated subhaloes luminosity templates.

Of course also in this case the main code of this project can be found at https://github.com/shinichiroando/sashimi-c for the cold dark matter case and at https://github.com/shinichiroando/sashimi-w for the warm dark matter case (SASHIMI project). This model is explained and shows its results in this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07691.pdf.
